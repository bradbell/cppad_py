# Convert a Numpy Array to a cppad_py Vector
# ##########################################
#
# Syntax
# ******
#
# | *vec* =  ``cppad_py.utility.numpy2vec`` (
# | |tab| *array* , *dtype* , *shape* , *context* , *name*
# | )
#
# array
# *****
# This is either a vector (only one index) or a matrix
# (has two indices) that we are converting to a vector.
# If this array does not match the conditions below,
# an exception is raised with an appropriate error message.
#
# dtype
# *****
# This is the expected data type for the elements of the array.
# It must be one of the following:
# ``bool`` , ``int`` , ``float`` or ``cppad_py.a_double`` .
#
# shape
# *****
# This either a ``int`` or a tuple of ``int`` with length one or two.
# If it is an ``int`` , *array* is expected to be a vector.
# If it is a tuple with length one, *array* is expected to be a vector.
# Otherwise a matrix is expected.
#
# context
# *******
# This is the context that *array* appears in
# (often to syntax for some other operation).
# It is a ``str`` that is used for error reporting.
#
# name
# ****
# This is the name used for *array* in *context* .
# It is a ``str`` that is used for error reporting.
#
# vec
# ***
# This is the values of *array*
# as a vector is row major order.
# It has type ``vec_double`` if *dtype* is ``float`` ,
# and ``vec_a_double`` if *dtype* is ``a_double`` .
