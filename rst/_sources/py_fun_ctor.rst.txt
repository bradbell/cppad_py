# | *f* =  ``cppad_py.d_fun`` ()
#
# a_fun
# =====

# | *af* =  ``cppad_py.a_fun`` ( *f* )
#
# ax
# **
# This argument must be the same as
# :ref:`ax<py_independent@ax>`
# returned by the previous call to ``independent`` ; i.e.,
# it must be the independent variable vector.
# We use *n*
# to denote the number of independent variables (the size of *ax* ).
#
# ay
# **
# This argument is a numpy array with ``a_double`` elements.
# It specifies the dependent variables.
# We use *m*
# to denote the number of dependent variables (the size of *ay* ).
#
# f
# *
# This result is a function object that
# has a representation for the floating point operations
# that mapped the independent variables *ax*
# to the dependent variables *ay* .
# This object computes function and derivative values using
# ``double``
#
# Empty Function
# ==============
# In the case where *ax* and *ay* are not present
# the function is 'empty' and all its sizes are zero; see
# :ref:`cpp_fun_property-name`.
#
# af
# **
# This result is a function object that
# has a representation for the same function as *f* .
# This object computes function and derivative values using
# ``a_double``
# Initially, there are not Taylor coefficient stored in *af* ; i.e.,
# :ref:`af_size_order()<py_fun_property@size_order>` is zero.

# Example
# *******
# All of the examples use the ``d_fun`` constructor.
# The example :ref:`a_fun_xam_py-name` demonstrates the purpose of
# ``a_fun`` objects.
