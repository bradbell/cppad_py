   Mixed Class Constructor

   Syntax

   {xrst_literal
      # BEGIN_MIXED_CTOR
      # END_MIXED_CTOR
   }

   mixed_obj
   *********
   We refer to the value returned by this constructor as *mixed_obj*.

   fixed_init
   **********
   is a numpy vector with ``float`` elements.
   It specifies a value of the fixed effects for which the
   likelihood and prior functions can be evaluated and is used to
   initialize *mixed_obj*.
   This vector must be non-empty and the default value ``None`` is not valid.

   n_fixed
   =======
   We use the notation *n_fixed* for the length of *fixed_init* .

   random_init
   ***********
   is a numpy vector with ``float`` elements.
   It specifies a value of the random effects for which the
   likelihood and prior functions can be evaluated and is used to
   initialize *mixed_obj*.
   The default value for this argument ``None`` corresponds
   to the empty vector.

   n_random
   ========
   We use the notation *n_random* for the length of *random_init* .


   quasi_fixed
   ***********
   is True (False) if a quasi-Newton method (Newton method) is used to
   optimize the fixed effects. The Newton method requires computation
   of second derivatives.

   bool_sparsity
   *************
   is True (False) if CppAD should use boolean sparsity patterns
   (set sparsity patterns) for its internal calculations

   A_rcv
   *****
   Is a :ref:`sparse_rcv<py_sparse_rcv-name>` representation of the
   random constraint matrix :math:`A`; i.e.
   :math:`A \cdot \hat{u} ( \theta ) = 0`
   where :math:`\hat{u} ( \theta )` is the
   optimal random effects as a function of the fixed effects.
   The value ``None`` corresponds to no random constraint.

   warning
   *******
   is a python function that gets called when *mixed_obj*
   has a warning to report; see :ref:`mixed_warning-title`.
   The value ``None`` corresponds to ignoring all warning messages.

   fix_likelihood
   **************
   see :ref:`mixed_fix_likelihood-title` .
   The value ``None`` corresponds to no fixed effects likelihood.

   fix_constraint
   **************
   see :ref:`mixed_fix_constraint-title` .
   The value ``None`` corresponds to no constraint function
   for the fixed effects (one can still have bound constraints).

   ran_likelihood
   **************
   see :ref:`mixed_ran_likelihood-title` .
   The value ``None`` corresponds to no random effects likelihood.
