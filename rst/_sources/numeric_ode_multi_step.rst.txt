#
# Syntax
# ******
# *y_all* =  ``ode_multi_step`` ( *one_step* , *f* , *t_all* , *y_init* )
#
# Purpose
# *******
# The routine can be used with ``ad_double`` to solve an initial
# value ODE
#
# .. math::
#
#    y^{(1)} (t) = f( t , y )
#
# one_step
# ********
# This routine executes one step of an ODE approximation method with the
# following syntax:
#
# | |tab| *y1* = *one_step* ( *f* , *t0* , *y0* , *t_step* )
#
# The elements of *y0* and the scalars above can be
# ``float`` or ``a_double`` .
#
# t0
# ==
# is the initial time value for the step.
#
# y0
# ==
# is the initial value of :math:`y(t)` for the step.
#
# t_step
# ======
# is the is the size of the step (in time).
#
# y1
# ==
# is the approximation for the ODE solution at time *t0* + *t_step* .
#
# fun
# ***
#
# fun.set_t_all_index(index)
# ==========================
# Often, we use interpolation with knots to define :math:`f(t, y)`.
# It is one of the subtitle issues of AD that even though values are the
# same, derivatives might not be the same; e.g.,
# piecewise linear interpolation.
# We must break the integration of the ODE at each of the knot
# so we can use a method that assumes :math:`f(t, y)` is smooth.
# Also so that AD can be used to compute derivatives of our solutions.
# The function ``set_t_all_index``
# informs *fun* that we are currently integrating the time interval
#
# | |tab| [ *t_all* [ *index* ] , *t_all* [ *index* +1] ]
#
# so that it know which smooth function to represent
# even if :math:`t` is at a knot and it matters if it is the interval
# to the left or right of the knot.
# The function ``set_t_all_index`` is called at the start
# of each integration interval and before any of the other
# *fun* member functions.
#
# fun.f(t, y)
# ===========
# This call evaluates the function that defines the ODE
#
# .. math::
#
#    y^{(1)} (t) = f [ t , y(t) ]
#
# one_step
# ========
# The routine *one_step* may put extra requirements on *fun* .
#
# t_all
# *****
# This is a numpy vector of time values at which the solution is calculated.
# The type of its elements can be ``float`` or ``ad_double`` .
# It must be either monotone increasing or decreasing.
#
# y_init
# ******
# This is the value of :math:`y(t)` at the initial time
# *t_all* [ 0 ] as a numpy vector.
# The type of its elements can be ``float`` or ``ad_double`` .
#
# y_all
# *****
# This is the approximate solution for :math:`y(t)` at all of the
# times specified by *t_all* as a numpy array.
# The value *y_all* [ *i* , *j* ] is the value of the j-th
# component of :math:`y(t)` at time *t_all* [ *i* ] .
