.. _spell_py:

Spell Example
=============

Text
----
The words ``iterable`` and ``sphinxrst`` are not the dictionary,
so we have included them in the spelling command for this section.


Math
----
The latex commands for greek letters
are automatically included as correct spelling.
Other latex commands in this section; e.g. ``\cos``, ``\sin``, ``\rm``,
have been included in the spelling command for this section.
An alternative is to add them to the
:ref:`spell_list<sphinxrst_py_spell_list>` for all sections:

.. math::

    z = \cos( \theta ) + {\rm i} \sin( \theta )
