=============
Spell Example
=============

.. _spell_py.text:

Text
----
The words ``iterable`` and ``sphinxrst`` are not the dictionary,
so we have included them in the spelling command for this section.

.. _spell_py.math:

Math
----
The latex commands for greek letters
are automatically included as correct spelling.
Other latex commands in this section; e.g. ``\cos``, ``\sin``, ``\rm``,
have been included in the spelling command for this section.
An alternative is to add them to the
:ref:`spell_list<sphinxrst_py.command_line_arguments.spell_list>`
for all sections:

.. math::

    z = \cos( \theta ) + {\rm i} \sin( \theta )

.. _spell_py.source:
